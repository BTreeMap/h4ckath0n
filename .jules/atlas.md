## 2026-02-28 - API route substring matching is unreliable for drift checks

**Learning:** Checking whether a path string appears *anywhere* in a README causes false negatives
when one route's path is a substring of another (e.g. `/auth/passkeys/{key_id}` inside
`/auth/passkeys/{key_id}/revoke`). The drift check must match `METHOD /path` as a combined token,
ideally inside backtick delimiters, to avoid this trap.

**Action:** Always match method+path together in drift checks. Use `` `METHOD /path` `` patterns
that mirror the actual markdown formatting.

## 2026-02-28 - Env var documentation drift

**Learning:** Environment variables documented in README.md quickly drift from the Pydantic Settings class which serves as the source of truth for the configuration.
**Action:** Always generate the environment variables documentation directly from the Pydantic Settings model using `scripts/generate_env_docs.py` to prevent drift.
